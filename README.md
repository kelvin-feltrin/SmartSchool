## About the project
The "SmartSchool" project was developed to practice the development of an application that uses Angular and an C# .NET Web API.

The application is a school system that manages students and teachers, and allows the user to create, read, update and delete new data.

Project based on Vinícius de Andrade's tutorial: [ANGULAR + ASP.NET Core API + EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWNaqtzH6CWSbIYlgMDQZNrwDG3gHw7wa)
